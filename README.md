The goal of this project is to develop a system for recognizing vehicle number plates using existing surveillance cameras. The system will capture images of vehicles and use image segmentation to extract the number plate region. Optical character recognition (OCR) will then be used to recognize the characters on the number plate. The resulting data will be compared with records in a database to retrieve specific information about the vehicle. The system has been implemented and tested on real images, and it has been found to be successful in detecting and recognizing vehicle number plates.
